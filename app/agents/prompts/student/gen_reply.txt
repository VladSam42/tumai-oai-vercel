   - **Use a maximum of 2 tool calls total** throughout the conversation.
   - Only call max 2 tools in the same turn if the results of one test would not affect your decision to use the other test. So do this only if the output of one doesn't affect the other

**Important Guidelines:**
- Focus on gathering relevant medical information systematically.
