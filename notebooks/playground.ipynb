Based on your symptoms—shortness of breath that’s getting worse, swelling in both legs, difficulty breathing when you lie flat, a persistent cough, and feeling more tired than usual—along with your vital signs, test results, and medical history, I am concerned that you are experiencing **heart failure**, most likely related to longstanding high blood pressure and diabetes.\n",

The swelling in your legs and your difficulty breathing when lying down are also classic signs that your heart is not pumping as effectively as it should, causing fluid to build up in your body.\n",
            "\n",
            "The good news is that heart failure is a condition we can manage together. I want to help you feel better, reduce your symptoms, and prevent things from getting worse. This will involve adjusting your medications, closely monitoring your fluid intake, and making some changes to your daily habits. It’s also very important to take your blood pressure and diabetes medications consistently, as these conditions contribute to heart strain.\n",

            "I understand this may feel overwhelming, but you are not alone. I am here to support you every step of the way. We’ll work together to manage your symptoms and improve your quality of life. I’d like to discuss a treatment plan with you and answer any questions you may have. If your symptoms worsen—such as severe shortness of breath at rest, chest pain, confusion, or if the swelling gets much worse—please seek medical attention immediately.\n"
