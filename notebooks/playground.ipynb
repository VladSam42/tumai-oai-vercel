I feel short of breath, especially when I move around or try to take a deep breath. I also have this dry cough that won't go away. There's no real chest pain, but I do feel a bit uncomfortable in my chest when I breathe in deeply. I've felt more tired than usual, and I've had some mild fevers at home. I just don't feel like myself.\n",
